ML model that predicts the time it takes for a driver to finish a given route with characteristics: Weather, Delivery Area, and Number of Packages.

Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to create a fully functional Route Organizer, basically an automated way to assign drivers to certain routes based on drivers' past data and characteristics of routes.
